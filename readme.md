# Minecraft Disaster Plugin

This Minecraft (Bukkit) aims to provide the use the ability to activate random disasters to occur in game, adding a new sense of challenge and unpredictability to the game.

Once installed the plugin will be activated by /disaster enable [time] [countdown]

The time variable is how long between disasters and the countdown is how long before the disasters start.

By default, the time is 5 minutes and the countdown is 10 seconds, so once /disaster enable is run, a 10 second countdown will start, then a random disaster will occur every 5 minutes.
